# == MindGames.io ==

As like minded individuals who wish to make a world better through technology and design,
we created this game as part of our college project for Computational Thinking & Design. 

Our main goal is to code a user-friendly game library which consists of several mind games 
which helps instigate active thinking. With that in mind, we came up with 4 games which 
include: Tic-Tac-Toe, Matching Tiles, Reaction Test and Cognitive Colours, all of which 
are simple games but require a certain level of thinking and concentration.

Our game library named as MindGames.io targets a wide range of players from all age groups, 
however it would greatly benefit the elderly and children. 
As MindGames.io consists of games which are categorized as problem-solving, 
it instigates the brain for active thinking which has been proved to help prevent dementia. 
Additionally, these games also help build skills like team building by instigating 
competition, which is essential in youth nowadays. 

As developers we thought deeply about the structure and modularity of our application 
with it being a game library, therefore we leveraged on object-orientated programming (OOP) 
to code our games to enhance modularity and used Pythonâ€™s inbuild GUI class tkinter for 
our application. 
Therefore, by leveraging on OOP the application is easily scalable and more games 
could be added into the library easily making it highly modular and user-friendly.
